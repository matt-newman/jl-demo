# Thoughts:

For code example purposes I'll minimize framework usage for the actual site, but will obviously use established tooling for build purposes.

Project quick start thoughts:
- jest for unit testing
    * easy to setup/use
    * excellent support and well understood
    * gives code coverage
- cypress.io for e2e tests
    * easy to start
    * visual regression available
- circle-ci for automated build
